I really am not sure what should I write here about the book.
All my understanding, most likely, was validated in the book.
Not that I care about spirituality and things related to that.
But to be honest the book was not really impactful for me.
May be it is impactful for people who don't know the basics. 
This could be true.
For example, if someone already knows general theory of relativity and someone comes and explains newtonian physics, then he already knows it implicitly!
True
but to cavemen with some intelligence, unaware of everything, if newton explains movement of stars and planets, they feel crazy!
True.
The book was really interesting in the beginning chapters, full of energy and thought.
But later on, i could not really grasp why did Siddhartha wanted to be with kamala. 
Because of that thought / feeling only, everything happened. It lasted for 20 years!

then when he left kamala, he was a ferriman for around 11 years!

Again, this is just a `fiction`.
so I guess its okay. No need to think more about it than that.

I must say, i really liked the dialogue style of the book. It was certainly different.
Not similar to anything I have ever read till now.

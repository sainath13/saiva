There are some books, upon finishing them, you go on talking about it. One can not really stop thinking about those books upon finishing them. and then after only a few day, may be mere hours, one forgets about that book the story the characters all together
and then
there are these types of books
Like mazi janmathep
I took my own time to finish listening to this book. I think around 4 months or so
Today i could finish it. Savarkar Sutale.
Its really hard to imagine what he went through. and that too for over a decade.
Its also certainly very hard to grasp how much he loved the nation
Even after getting out of the jails he continued fighting for the independence of india. Thats really commendable.
I mean, I learnt a lot by reading this book
How right were british government officers for not letting him out.
He surely was a dangerous man. I mean look at what he could achieve inside the jail. That too after staying inside the jail for a whole decade. 


I should make this habit of taking notes while reading the book itself.
That way the listening become more of an active activity than a passive leisurely activity. I guess thats true. Lets try that more going forward.

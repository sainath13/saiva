# Chapter 1 : 
### Paradigm 
	paradigm is the way you “see,” interpret, or understand the world.
	a paradigm is a **framework or model** through which people interpret and approach a particular area of knowledge or activity
> “There is no real excellence in all this world which can be separated from right living.”

###  Character Ethic
- **Definition**: Focuses on the deeper principles and values that form the foundation of success.
- **Key Idea**: True effectiveness comes from building a strong character—qualities like integrity, humility, courage, justice, patience, and industry.
- **Approach**: Long-term growth through internal change.
- **Example**: _Be honest, keep commitments, work hard, and success will follow._
    
### Personality Ethic
- **Definition**: Focuses on external techniques, image, and social skills to achieve success.
- **Key Idea**: Emphasizes appearance and quick fixes over underlying principles.
- **Approach**: Short-term gains through charm, persuasion techniques, or image management.
- **Example**: _Use communication tricks to influence people even if you don’t genuinely respect them._

Covey argues that while Personality Ethic can bring temporary success, lasting effectiveness is built on the **Character Ethic**.

Did you ever consider how ridiculous it would be to try to cram on a farm—to forget to plant in the spring, play all summer and then cram in the fall to bring in the harvest? The farm is a natural system. The price must be paid and the process followed. You always reap what you sow; there is no shortcut.

The more aware we are of our basic paradigms, maps, or assumptions, and the extent to which we have been influenced by our experience, the more we can take responsibility for those paradigms, examine them,test them against reality, listen to others and be open to their perceptions, thereby getting a larger picture and a far more objective view.

“For every thousand hacking at the leaves of evil, there is one striking at the root.”

“How can we remember our ignorance, which our growth requires, when we are using our knowledge all the time?”

“Using intimidation builds weakness because it reinforces dependence on external factors to get things done. When fear replaces cooperation, both people involved become more illogical and defensive.”

Albert Einstein observed, “The significant problems we face cannot be solved at the same level of thinking we were at when we created them.”

“Inside-out” means to start first with self; even more fundamentally, to start with the most inside part of self—with your paradigms, your character, and your motives.

“We must not cease from exploration and the end of all our exploring will be to arrive where we began and to know the place for the first time.”

We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.

Sow a thought, reap an action; sow an action, reap a habit; sow a habit, reap a character; sow a character, reap a destiny,” the maxim goes.
“Lift off” takes a tremendous effort, but once we break out of the gravity pull, our freedom takes on a whole new dimension.

Knowledge is the theoretical paradigm, the what to do and the why. Skill is the how to do. And desire is the motivation, the want to do. In order to make something a habit in our lives, we have to have all three.
### Maturity Continuum
- **Dependence**: Focus is on _you_. Example thoughts: _You need to do this for me. You need to take care of that for me._
- **Independence**: Focus is on _I_. Example thoughts: _I am capable. I am doing this. I am achieving that._
- **Interdependence**: Focus is on _we_. Example thoughts: _We can do this together. We can combine our talents. We can achieve greater results collectively._

### P/PC Balance
The **P/PC Balance Principle** (from Covey’s book) stands for:
- **P (Production)** – The results or output you want (the “golden eggs”).
- **PC (Production Capability)** – The ability or asset that produces the results (the “goose” that lays the golden eggs).
Effectiveness comes from **balancing** producing desired results (**P**) with maintaining and nurturing the capability that produces them (**PC**).
- If you work your team (or yourself) too hard to get quick results (focus only on P), you may burn out the capability (PC).
- If you spend too much time maintaining capability without producing, you also fail to achieve results.
The principle: **Don’t kill the goose that lays the golden eggs.**

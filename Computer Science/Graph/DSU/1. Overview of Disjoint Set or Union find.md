`Usecase` : how to check if two vertices are connected?

The primary use of disjoint sets is to address the connectivity between the components of a network. The “network“ here can be a computer network or a social network. For instance, we can use a disjoint set to determine if two people share a common ancestor.

### Terminologies

- Parent node: the direct parent node of a vertex.
- Root node: a node without a parent node; it can be viewed as the parent node of itself.

Nodes with same head or root are connected

Initially the root array looks like this! every node is root node meaning parent of itself

Check if vertices are connected?

Just check if they both have the same `root nodes`!

![[Disjoint set finding root.png]]

Find () -------> find the _root_ node of a given node (not the parent node)
union() ------> connects nodes X and Y and chooses a parent node for both of them. Unions two vertices and makes their root nodes the same.

Two ways to implement disjoint sets:
[[2. Quick find]]
find O(1) but Union O(N)
[[3. Quick Union]]
Union Time complexity is better but find takes more time

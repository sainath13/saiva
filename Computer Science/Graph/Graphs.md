Undirected graphs

Directed graphs

Weighted graphs

Terminology 
	`Vertex` is a node
	Edge
	Path
	Cycle
	Negative weight cycle : If the sum of the weights of all edges of a cycle is a negative value
	Connectivity --> are two vertices connected? 
	Degree of vertex : No of edges connecting to the vertex (direct connections)
	In degree : directed graph concept : directional edges incident to vertex
	Out degree : directed graph concept : edges incident from the vertex

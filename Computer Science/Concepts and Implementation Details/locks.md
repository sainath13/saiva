Understanding **pessimistic**  and **optimistic locking**  is key when dealing with concurrency in operating systems or databases. Here's a clear breakdown:

---
### ðŸ”’ Pessimistic Lock 
**Assumption:** 
Conflicts *will happen*, so we prevent them by locking resources early.
**How it works:** 
- A lock (read or write) is acquired *before* accessing a shared resource.
- Other processes/threads are blocked until the lock is released.
- Used when contention (conflict) is likely.
**Pros:** 
- Prevents conflicts entirely.
- Guarantees consistency.
**Cons:** 
- Can reduce concurrency (other operations are blocked).
- Deadlocks or performance bottlenecks can occur.

**Example Use Case:** 
Database systems with high write contention â€” e.g., updating bank balances.

### ðŸª¶ Optimistic Lock 
**Assumption:** 
Conflicts *are rare*, so we allow concurrent access and check for issues before committing changes.
**How it works:** 
- No lock is acquired at the start.
- A version number or timestamp is used.
- Before committing a change, the system checks if the resource has changed since it was read.
- If it has, the operation fails and retries.
**Pros:** 
- Allows high concurrency.
- Efficient when conflicts are infrequent.
**Cons:** 
- Requires conflict resolution logic.
- Can lead to repeated retries under high contention.
**Example Use Case:** 
Web applications with many reads and few writes â€” e.g., editing a user profile.

### Quick Comparison 

| Feature                       | Pessimistic Lock | Optimistic Lock            |     |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------- | --- |
| Conflict Assumption           | Likely           | Unlikely                   |     |
| Lock Timing                   | Before access    | Before commit (validation) |     |
| Performance (low contention)  | Lower            | Higher                     |     |
| Performance (high contention) | More stable      | Can degrade (more retries) |     |
| Complexity                    | Lower            | Higher                     |     |

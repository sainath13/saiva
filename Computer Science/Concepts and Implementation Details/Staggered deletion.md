**Staggered deletion** is a technique used to delete large numbers of rows from a database **in smaller batches**, rather than all at once. This helps **reduce load on the database**, **minimize locking**, **avoid long transactions**, and **prevent performance issues**â€”especially in production environments.

### ðŸ”§ Example of Staggered Deletion:
Letâ€™s say you want to delete 100,000 rows from a table where a condition matches. Instead of:
`DELETE FROM notifications WHERE is_read = true;`
You do something like:

`Pseudo-loop 
	WHILE (1=1) DO   
		DELETE FROM notifications   WHERE is_read = true   
			LIMIT 1000;    
	-- Break the loop if no rows were deleted
	   IF ROW_COUNT() = 0 THEN
	    LEAVE;   END IF;
	END WHILE;`

`DELETE FROM notifications WHERE is_read = true LIMIT 1000;`
Run the above multiple times (manually or via a script) until all desired rows are deleted.

### âœ… Benefits of Staggered Deletion:

- **Avoids locking large parts of the table**
- **Keeps queries fast** and responsive
- **Reduces transaction log bloat**
- **Prevents timeouts or crashes in busy systems**

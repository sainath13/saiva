You: 

what if i used LinkedList here instead of ArrayList. shouldnt really matter right?

Great question — it seems simple, but it’s actually tied to some key performance characteristics of `ArrayList` vs `LinkedList` in Java.

In your code:

```java
List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
```

You could replace `ArrayList` with `LinkedList` and **your code would still work correctly**. But the reason `ArrayList` is generally preferred here comes down to **performance and usage patterns**.

### Key Differences Between `ArrayList` and `LinkedList`:

| Aspect                | `ArrayList`                    | `LinkedList`                 |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| Internal structure    | Dynamic array                  | Doubly linked list           |
| Random access         | O(1)                           | O(n)                         |
| Insertion at end      | Amortized O(1)                 | O(1)                         |
| Insertion in middle   | O(n) (due to shifting)         | O(n) (due to traversal)      |
| Iteration performance | Faster (better cache locality) | Slower                       |
| Memory overhead       | Lower                          | Higher (extra node pointers) |

### Why `ArrayList` is Preferred in Most Cases:
1.  **Access Pattern**:
    -   In your code, you’re **mostly appending to the list** and not inserting in the middle or deleting frequently. `ArrayList` is **more efficient for appending** and iterating.
    -   `LinkedList` shines when you have lots of **insertions/removals at arbitrary positions**, which you're not doing here.
2.  **Better cache performance**:
    -   `ArrayList` stores elements in a contiguous memory block, which is CPU-cache-friendly, making iteration faster.
3.  **Memory overhead**:
    -   Each node in a `LinkedList` holds extra memory for previous and next pointers. If you're working with many small lists (which is common when grouping anagrams), that overhead adds up.
4.  **Simplicity and convention**:
    -   `ArrayList` is the default go-to for `List` unless you specifically need `LinkedList` features.

### TL;DR

Yes, your code would **still work with `LinkedList`**, but `ArrayList` is preferred for **better iteration performance, lower memory usage, and faster append operations**, which match your use case (grouping and collecting strings).

Let me know if you want to test or benchmark the difference between the two in this context — happy to help.

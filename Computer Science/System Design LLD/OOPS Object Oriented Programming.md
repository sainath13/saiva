Key Characteristics of a Class: (Blueprint)
	Attributes = State
	Methods = Behaviour
	Constructor 
Key Characteristics of Object: (Instance of Blueprint)
	State : Represented by objects attributes
	Behaviour : Methods
	Identity : Unique reference to the object in memory

# The Family Tree of Classes : Inheritance == Is-a
> Inheritance represents an "is-a" relationship where a subclass inherits properties and behaviours from its parent class.

```Java
void eat() {
    System.out.println("Animal is eating.");
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks: Woof Woof!");
    }
}

public class InheritanceDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog dog = new Dog();
        dog.eat(); // Inherited behavior
        dog.bark(); // Specific behavior
    }
}
```


# Side by Side : Association

![[Pasted image 20250703152907.png]]
> Association is a general relationship where one class knows about or uses another. It's like a friendship‚Äîtwo entities are aware of each other, but they exist independently.

```java
// A Person can have a Car.
class Car {
    String model;

    Car(String model) {
        this.model = model;
    }

    void drive() {
        System.out.println("Driving a " + model);
    }
}

class Person {
    String name;
    // Association: A Person "has a" Car.
    Car car;

    Person(String name, Car car) {
        this.name = name;
        this.car = car;
    }

    void goForDrive() {
        System.out.println(name + " is going for a drive.");
        car.drive();
    }
}

public class AssociationDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car car = new Car("Tesla Model 3");
        Person person = new Person("Alice", car);
        person.goForDrive();
    }
}
```
 
‚Ä¢ Person has a reference to Car, representing an association.
‚Ä¢ Both Person and Car exist independently. The Car doesn't rely solely on the Person for its existence.

# Aggregation: Grouping with a Twist
Aggregation is a specialized form of association that represents a "has-a" relationship where the parts can exist independently of the whole‚Äîbut they are grouped together by a container.
Think of a Team and its Players: a team has players, yet the players can exist even if the team is disbanded.
![[Pasted image 20250703155004.png]]
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

class Player {
    String name;

    Player(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}

class Team {
    String teamName;
    // Aggregation: A team "has" players.
    List<Player> players = new ArrayList<>();

    Team(String teamName) {
        this.teamName = teamName;
    }

    void addPlayer(Player player) {
        players.add(player);
    }

    void showTeam() {
        System.out.println("Team " + teamName + " has players:");
        for (Player p : players) {
            System.out.println(" - " + p.name);
        }
    }
}

public class AggregationDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Team team = new Team("Warriors");
        team.addPlayer(new Player("Stephen"));
        team.addPlayer(new Player("Klay"));
        team.showTeam();
    }
}
```

### Key Differences Between Association and Aggregation:
‚Ä¢ Association is a general relationship (friendship) with no ownership implied; objects simply interact or use each other.
‚Ä¢ Aggregation represents a ‚Äúhas-a‚Äù relationship where one object (the whole) contains or references other objects (the parts), but the parts can exist independently of the whole.

# Bond for Life: Composition
Composition is a stronger form of aggregation with full ownership‚Äîif the whole is destroyed, the parts cannot exist independently. Think of a House and its Rooms: without the house, the rooms cease to exist.
![[Pasted image 20250703155156.png]]
```java
class Room {
    String name;

    Room(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}

class House {
    // Composition: A House is composed of Rooms.
    private Room livingRoom;
    private Room kitchen;

    House() {
        // Rooms are created and owned by the House.
        livingRoom = new Room("Living Room");
        kitchen = new Room("Kitchen");
    }

    void showHouse() {
        System.out.println("House contains: " + livingRoom.name + " and " + kitchen.name);
    }
}

public class CompositionDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        House house = new House();
        house.showHouse();
    }
}
```



# Just a Little Dependency: Dependency
Dependency represents a temporary relationship where one class uses another class, typically via method parameters or local variables. It‚Äôs like borrowing a tool for a short while.
![[Pasted image 20250703155300.png]]
```java
class Printer {
    void print(String message) {
        System.out.println("Printing: " + message);
    }
}

class Document {
    String content;

    Document(String content) {
        this.content = content;
    }

    // Dependency: Document uses Printer to print its content.
    void printDocument(Printer printer) {
        printer.print(content);
    }
}

public class DependencyDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Document doc = new Document("Hello, World!");
        Printer printer = new Printer();
        doc.printDocument(printer);
    }
}
```

### Key Differences Between Association and Dependency:
üîó **Association:**
Objects are passed (often via constructors or setters) and stored as persistent fields. This creates a long-term relationship where the object is available throughout the lifetime of the class. For example, a Person stores a reference to a Car and uses it whenever needed.

‚û°Ô∏è **Dependency:**
Objects are passed as method parameters and used only within that method's scope. This creates a short-term, temporary relationship where the object is used just for the duration of the method call, and isn't stored for later use. For example, a Document receives a Printer to print its content and doesn't keep a reference to the Printer afterward.


# Realization (Interface Implementation)
![[Pasted image 20250703155937.png]]

Realization represents a relationship where a class implements an interface. It‚Äôs like signing a contract to provide specific behaviors.

```java
interface Payment {
    void pay();
}

class CreditCardPayment implements Payment {
    @Override
    public void pay() {
        System.out.println("Paid using Credit Card.");
    }
}

class CashPayment implements Payment {
    @Override
    public void pay() {
        System.out.println("Paid using Cash.");
    }
}

public class RealizationDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Payment payment1 = new CreditCardPayment();
        Payment payment2 = new CashPayment();
        payment1.pay();
        payment2.pay();
    }
}

```

# Summary Explanation

**üìñ Readable Interface:**
	Defines a contract with a read() method. The Book class implements this interface, ensuring that all books provide a reading behavior.

üì≤ **Book and EBook:**
	Book has attributes for title and an associated Author. EBook extends Book by adding a fileFormat attribute. The inheritance arrow (solid line with a closed arrowhead) shows that EBook is a specialized type of Book.

üîó **Association (Book & Author):**
	The arrow from Book to Author indicates that every book is written by an author. This is a simple association where both objects can exist independently.

üìö **Composition (Library & Book):**
	The filled diamond from Library to Book indicates composition. A library is composed of books, meaning the library strongly owns its books.

üìñ‚û°Ô∏èüìï **Dependency (Reader & Book):**
	The dashed arrow from Reader to Book denotes a dependency. A reader uses a book (for example, to read), but does not own it.
‚Äç

üìö‚û°Ô∏èüë• **Aggregation (ReadingClub & Reader):**
	The open diamond from ReadingClub to Reader represents aggregation. A reading club groups readers together, but readers can exist independently of the club.

**Microeconomics** is a branch of economics that focuses on the behavior and decision-making of **individual units**, such as:

- **Consumers (households)**
- **Firms (businesses)**
- **Industries (markets)**
  It studies how these entities interact in markets to determine prices, allocate resources, and respond to changes in supply and demand.

### Key Concepts in Microeconomics:

1. **Demand and Supply** – How prices are determined in competitive markets.
2. **Elasticity** – How sensitive quantity demanded or supplied is to changes in price.
3. **Consumer Behavior** – How individuals make choices to maximize satisfaction (utility).
4. **Production and Costs** – How firms decide on the quantity to produce and the costs involved.
5. **Market Structures** – Types of markets (perfect competition, monopoly, oligopoly, monopolistic competition).
6. **Profit Maximization** – How firms make decisions to maximize profit.
7. **Market Failures** – Situations where markets fail to allocate resources efficiently (e.g., due to externalities or public goods).

### Micro vs. Macro:

- **Microeconomics**: Individual markets and agents.
- **Macroeconomics**: Economy as a whole (inflation, unemployment, GDP, etc.).

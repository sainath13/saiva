**Microeconomics** is a branch of economics that focuses on the behavior and decision-making of **individual units**, such as:
- **Consumers (households)**
- **Firms (businesses)**
- **Industries (markets)**
  It studies how these entities interact in markets to determine prices, allocate resources, and respond to changes in supply and demand.

### Key Concepts in Microeconomics:

1. **Demand and Supply** – How prices are determined in competitive markets.
2. **Elasticity** – How sensitive quantity demanded or supplied is to changes in price.
3. **Consumer Behavior** – How individuals make choices to maximize satisfaction (utility).
4. **Production and Costs** – How firms decide on the quantity to produce and the costs involved.
5. **Market Structures** – Types of markets (perfect competition, monopoly, oligopoly, monopolistic competition).
6. **Profit Maximization** – How firms make decisions to maximize profit.
7. **Market Failures** – Situations where markets fail to allocate resources efficiently (e.g., due to externalities or public goods).

### Micro vs. Macro:

- **Microeconomics**: Individual markets and agents.
- **Macroeconomics**: Economy as a whole (inflation, unemployment, GDP, etc.).

[[Opportunity cost]] represents the potential benefits an individual or business misses out on when choosing one option over another.
It's the value of the best alternative forgone.
Understanding opportunity cost helps make more informed decisions by considering what's given up when a choice is made.
`Every action or Inaction has a cost`




### Supply and Demand Model :
- - The market equilibrium is where the supply and demand curves intersect 


Positive Analysis : Study of the things the way they are
Normative Analysis : Study of the things the way they should be
Eg : Selling kidneys on ebay
	Normative questions involve considerations of market failures, equity, and behavioral economics

Capitalistic vs Command economy
A capitalistic economy is where firms and individuals decide what to produce and consume
A command economy is where the government makes all production and consumption decisions

Adam Smith's concept of the "invisible hand" suggests that individuals and firms acting in their own self-interest can benefit society as a whole


The "invisible hand" is a metaphor introduced by the 18th-century Scottish economist Adam Smith in his book _The Wealth of Nations_ (1776). It describes the unintended social benefits resulting from individuals acting in their own self-interest within a free market.  

Here's a breakdown of the concept:

- **Self-Interest as the Driving Force:** Smith observed that individuals in a market economy are primarily motivated by their own gain. Businesses aim to maximize profits, and consumers seek the best value for their money.
- **Unintended Positive Outcomes:** According to Smith, this pursuit of individual self-interest inadvertently leads to positive outcomes for society as a whole. It's as if an "invisible hand" guides these individual actions towards the common good.  
    
- **How it Works (Examples):**
    - **Production Efficiency:** To maximize profits, businesses strive to produce goods and services efficiently and at competitive prices. This benefits consumers through lower prices and better quality.  
        
    - **Resource Allocation:** If there's a high demand for a particular product, businesses will be incentivized to produce more of it, leading to an efficient allocation of resources based on consumer needs.
    - **Innovation:** Competition among businesses encourages innovation and the development of new and better products and services, further benefiting society.  
        
- **The Role of Free Markets:** The invisible hand is most effective in a free market where there is minimal government intervention. Smith argued against mercantilist policies and advocated for free trade and competition. He believed that government intervention could distort the natural forces of supply and demand.  
    
- **It's a Metaphor, Not a Literal Force:** It's crucial to understand that the invisible hand isn't an actual entity or a conscious force. It's a way of describing the complex and often unforeseen consequences of individual economic decisions interacting within a market.  
    

**In simpler terms:** Imagine many individuals buying and selling goods and services, each trying to get the best deal for themselves. Even though no one is intentionally trying to benefit society as a whole, the combined effect of these self-interested actions leads to a well-functioning economy that provides goods and services that people want and need.

**Important Considerations:**

- **Market Failures:** Smith recognized that the invisible hand might not always lead to the best outcomes, particularly in cases of market failures such as monopolies, externalities (like pollution), and the need for public goods. In these situations, some level of government intervention might be necessary.
- **Ethical Considerations:** While self-interest is a key component, Smith's broader work on moral sentiments also emphasizes the importance of ethics and social considerations within a functioning society. The invisible hand operates within a framework of laws, customs, and moral principles.  
    

In essence, Adam Smith's concept of the invisible hand is a foundational idea in economics, suggesting that the pursuit of individual economic self-interest in a free market can lead to overall economic prosperity and benefit society, as if guided by an unseen force.
